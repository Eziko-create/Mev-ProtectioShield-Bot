# 🛡️ MEV Protection Shield Bot for Solana Blockchain

## 🚀 About the Project

The **MEV Protection Shield Bot** is a cutting-edge Web3 tool built to **safeguard Solana's performance integrity** and monitor the network in real-time. Designed with blockchain security and validator efficiency in mind, this bot detects **block lags, failed transactions, potential validator delays, and MEV attack symptoms**.

It serves as a decentralized security watchtower—sending **live alerts** to a Telegram channel whenever a disruption or anomaly is detected.

## 🌐 Why It Matters

The Solana ecosystem, though incredibly fast and efficient, isn't immune to MEV (Miner Extractable Value) threats, validator slowness, or network disruptions. This bot is built to:

- 🧠 Help **validators**, **security experts**, and **builders** monitor real-time slot activity  
- ⚙️ Instantly report **network lag**, **anomalies**, and **failures**  
- 📊 Provide a **first-response alert system** for the health of the Solana network  
- 💡 Build toward a **safer and faster blockchain future**

> If we can **detect performance gaps early**, we can fix them even faster — and together, keep Solana truly unstoppable.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Connects to Solana RPC (`https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`)  
- Scans and tracks slot progression every 60 seconds  
- Sends an alert to the Telegram channel on:
  - Slot stagnation  
  - RPC failures  
  - Unexpected errors

## 👥 Who This Is For

- 🧪 **Validators & Node Operators** – for maintaining uptime and slot consistency  
- 🔐 **Security Researchers** – to spot MEV symptoms or attacks  
- 🧰 **Developers & Builders** – to integrate protection layers into apps  
- 💼 **Investors & Analysts** – to monitor network health in real time

## 🔧 Configuration

All important settings are in `config.py`:

```python
WALLET_ADDRESS = "2gBcMvRaVw5Ud9Vn2tUbe39oXFqVoqtmgcugp78xD4AA"
INTERVAL_SECONDS = 60  # how often to scan Solana slots
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "your_telegram_bot_token"  # Set this securely in config.py
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "your_channel_id"  # Example: -1001234567890
